See <a href=\"https://p5js.org/learn/getting-started-in-webgl-coords-and-transform.html\">the learn page about coordinates and transformations</a>.</li> <li><strong>3D Shapes</strong> - <code>WEBGL</code> mode can be used to draw 3-dimensional shapes like <a href=\"/reference/#/p5/box\">box()</a>, <a href=\"/reference/#/p5/sphere\">sphere()</a>, <a href=\"/reference/#/p5/cone\">cone()</a>, and <a href=\"/#Shape3D%20Primitives\">more</a>. See <a href=\"https://p5js.org/learn/getting-started-in-webgl-custom-geometry.html\">the learn page about custom geometry</a> to make more complex objects.</li> <li><strong>Shape Detail</strong> - When drawing in <code>WEBGL</code> mode, you can specify how smooth curves should be drawn by using a <code>detail</code> parameter. See <a href=\"https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Getting-started-with-WebGL-in-p5#3d-primitives-shapes\">the wiki section about shapes</a> for a more information and an example.</li> <li><strong>Textures</strong> - A texture is like a skin that wraps onto a shape. See <a href=\"https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Getting-started-with-WebGL-in-p5#textures\">the wiki section about textures</a> for examples of mapping images onto surfaces with textures.</li> <li><strong>Materials and Lighting</strong> - <code>WEBGL</code> offers different types of lights like <a href=\"/reference/#/p5/ambientLight\">ambientLight()</a> to place around a scene. Materials like <a href=\"/reference/#/p5/specularMaterial\">specularMaterial()</a> reflect the lighting to convey shape and depth. See <a href=\"https://p5js.org/learn/getting-started-in-webgl-appearance.html\">the learn page for styling and appearance</a> to experiment with different combinations.</li> <li><strong>Camera</strong> - The viewport of a <code>WEBGL</code> sketch can be adjusted by changing camera attributes. See <a href=\"https://p5js.org/learn/getting-started-in-webgl-appearance.html#camera\">the learn page section about cameras</a> for an explanation of camera controls.</li> <li><strong>Text</strong> - <code>WEBGL</code> requires opentype/truetype font files to be preloaded using <a href=\"/reference/#/p5/loadFont\">loadFont()</a>. See <a href=\"https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Getting-started-with-WebGL-in-p5#text\">the wiki section about text</a> for details, along with a workaround.</li> <li><strong>Shaders</strong> - Shaders are hardware accelerated programs that can be used for a variety of effects and graphics. See the <a href=\"https://p5js.org/learn/getting-started-in-webgl-shaders.html\">introduction to shaders</a> to get started with shaders in p5.js.</li> <li><strong>Graphics Acceleration</strong> - <code>WEBGL</code> mode uses the graphics card instead of the CPU, so it may help boost the performance of your sketch (example: drawing more shapes on the screen at once).</li> </ul>",
